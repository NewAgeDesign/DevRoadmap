# Welcome To PHP
PHP(Formerly Personal Home Page, now Hypertext Preprocessor) is a server-side scripting language designed for web development but also used as a general-purpose programming language.

However, we won't focus on server-side scripting just yet.

# 1. Setup PHP Environment

Before you can run PHP code, you need three main tools:

1. **A Web Browser** ‚Äì e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge.  
   - This is how you‚Äôll *see* the results of your PHP code.  

2. **A Text Editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment)** ‚Äì  
   - Example: **VS Code** (recommended), Sublime Text, or PHPStorm.  
   - This is where you‚Äôll *write* your code.  

3. **The PHP Environment** ‚Äì  
   - This is what *executes* your PHP code. You can set it up in two ways:  
     - **Manual installation** (advanced: installing PHP, Apache, MySQL separately, But we'll only install PHP).  
     - **Using a Server Simulator** (easy mode, all-in-one).

## Installing a Server Simulator (The Easy Way)

Server Simulators are beginner-friendly tools that bundle PHP with other necessary components like **Apache** (web server) and **MySQL** (database).  

üëâ Think of them as a ‚Äúready-made kitchen‚Äù ‚Äî you don‚Äôt have to buy each utensil separately.

## Popular Server Simulators

### 1. WAMP (Best for Windows)  
- Download: [WAMP](https://sourceforge.net/projects/wampserver/)  
- Install it like a normal Windows program.  
- Once installed, launch WAMP. You‚Äôll see a green/orange/red icon in the system tray (bottom-right corner).  
- **Turn services on**:  
  - Left-click the WAMP icon ‚Üí Start **Apache** (for running PHP) and **MySQL** (for databases).  
  - Make sure the icon turns **green** (means everything is running).  
- Your local web server is now ready!  

üìÇ Save your PHP files inside:  where_you_installed_wamp/wamp64/www/

### 2. XAMPP (Cross-Platform, More Complex)  
- Download: [XAMPP](https://www.apache_friends.org/index.html)  
- Works on **Windows, Mac, Linux**.  
- Install it ‚Üí Open the **XAMPP Control Panel**.  
- Start **Apache** and **MySQL** (they‚Äôll show a green ‚ÄúRunning‚Äù label).  
- Your local web server is ready.  

üìÇ Save your PHP files inside:  where_you_installed_xampp/xampp/htdocs/

üîó Run in browser:  localhost/project_folder_name/yourfile.php


**Benefits**
- Server Simulators offer the basic web server services (Apache, PHP, MySQL, and so on)
- You turn on the server and forget about it, for every time you turn your computer on.


## Installing the PHP Environment (The Hard Way)
PHP can also be installed separately, though it won't give you server like functions so we'll have to run our programs in the Command line(CMD, Powershell, VSCode CLI).

- Go to the [PHP website](#)
- Select Download
- Choose the PHP Version you'd like to download, I'll be using PHP 8.4.3
- Once downloaded, extract the file and place it in the C: directory.
- Open Environment Variables
- Edit Path and add your PHP directory (C:\PHP8.X.X\)
- Open your Terminal of choice and type php -version

to run your program, navigate to the file using your prefered terminal, or use vscode, the terminal will already take you to the folder by default, then type php filename.php
