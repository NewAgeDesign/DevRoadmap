PHP is a scripting Language that's also a hypertext preprocessor, this means that despite the fact that its a serverside scripting language, it also has support for HTML tags, opening up infinite posibilities for web development
- PHP uses the Web Stack : HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, and MySQL.

## Prerequisites

- Server Simmulator (WAMP(What I use, WINDOWS only), MAMP(MacOS), LAMP(Linux), XAMPP(Cross Platform)
- Then you'll need a text editor or IDE(Integrated Development Environment) (VScode, PHPStorm)

NB: I wont be teaching you how to install any of these, please visit their website for more details.

## 01. The PHP Structure
So PHP Supports HTML so by default, utilizes HTML Tags, however the PHP script runs exclusively in its own tag:
<code>
<?PHP
...Your PHP Script goes here
?>
</code>
