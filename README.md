# DevRoadmap
Most people say Software development is hard, I believe that its just a matter of Understanding the Fundamentals, so I'll be learning every programming language based on its particular paradigms, hopefully ordering them in terms of complexity and learning curve, but eventually documenting the learning process in the documentations.
---
## Roadmap
- We first begin from how the computer works, The Von Neumann Architecture by John Von Neumann, that part is theoretical.
- Then will cover programming aspects from input and output, along with learning variables and arithmetic operations. As well as structured programming and data structures and algorithms (Including Design and Analysis of Algorithms).
- Then we'll learn Imperative and Declarative programming paradigms as well as Operating System Algorithms so as to learn memory, resource and File management.
- We will also go through File Management.
- We will cover network protocols.
- We will cover Distributed Systems (APIs)
- We will cover cloud Computing
- We will cover AI and ML(Minus the Math, youre on your own with that one).

## Outcome
- Through the learning process, we will be creating multiple mini, midlevel and fully flegged apps based on the level of Learning.
- Since one can't build apps fully using just one language, we will be building apps using techstacks, we will also be building them according to the programming language we've decided to focus on.
- Don't forget to read the README.md Documentations.
